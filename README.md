## Introduction
In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep learning system to produce dense depth from sparse LiDAR data and a color image taken from outdoor on-road scenes leveraging surface normal as the intermediate representation.

## Requirements
- [Python2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PyTorch(0.4.0+)](http://pytorch.org)
- torchvision 0.2.0 (higher version may cause issues)
- [KITTI Depth Completion](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth.php?benchmark=depth_completion)
- [Our synthetic dataset based on CARLA](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ayNWa7_9Ia2f6_lYzW8paA)
### The Details about Our Synthetic dataset
You could ignore the folders named 'lidar_m', 'normal_s', 'RGBright' and 'Boundary'. (Maybe you also can use these for your own purpose)
```
'DepthLeft': The raw depth generated by CARLA, you can see the details in here [CARLA](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cameras_and_sensors/#sensorcameradepth)
'lidar': The lidar depth which projected into the camera coordinate. Each image is coded by 16-bit like KITTI.
'Lidar64': The raw lidar point cloud information.
'Normal_m': The surface normal calculated from 'DepthLeft'.
'RGBLeft': The RGB images.
```
### Pretrained Model
※NOTE: The pretrained model were saved in '.tar'; however, you don't need to untar it. Use torch.load() to load it.

## Train
1. Get the surface normal of Lidar dataset by running the code in the project named ['surface_normal'](https://github.com/Cindy-xdZhang/surface-normal).
2. Use the training strategy in the folder named 'trainings'.
## Evaluation
1. Fill the names of the folders in 'test.py':
```
'gt_fold': the location of your groundtruth folder;
'left_fold': the location of your RGB image folder;
'lidar2_raw': the location of your Sparse(LiDAR) depth folder.
```
 
2. Use the following command to evaluate the trained on your own data.
```
python test.py --loadmodel (your trained model)
```
